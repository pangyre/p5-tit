=head1 Name

Tit – A tiny bird of a web app framework.

=head2 See instead…

This is the document you really want: L<Tit::Manual>.

=head1 Rationale and Caveat

This is quite a bit like—but much less featureful than—lots of
micro-frameworks and even L<Dancer2>. This is probably not what you
want. It's alpha software until this notice is removed.

Rationale? I've been doing this a loooooooong time. I'm curious about
how little of it I really need for the things I write. I'm vain enough
to not settle on one of the current microframeworks.
